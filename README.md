# Examples

lab1c.c is from my operating systems course this quarter; it is a stripped down shell that is invoked using the standard shell syntax, but uses a simple array of strings to pass in commands and arguments, which the code parses. There are a number of options and flags for files, including a profiling option to track the time performance of this "simple shell" 

lab3b.py is from my operating systems course. The project built off a prior assignment, which took a potentially faulty ext2 file system image file, and gave seven csvs with metrics about the file system including information in the superblock, group descriptor tables, free bitmap entries, inodes, and more. In this project, we took these information files and analyzed them for errors in the file system corruptions, logging the errors in a text file. 

comm.py is a Python interpretation of the comm POSIX command that I made for my Linux Laboratory Course.
